        <h2>What is NAP?</h2>
        <p>
            NAP (Non-Aggression Pact) is an agreement between the most powerful alliances on the server to foster cooperation, reduce conflicts, and promote growth.
            It ensures that the NAP alliances and their academy alliances can thrive without interference while maintaining a fair and competitive environment for everyone.
        </p>
        <h2>Current NAP Alliances</h2>
        <p>The current NAP4 alliances include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="notranslate">LED</span></li>
            <li><span class="notranslate">EMA</span></li>
            <li><span class="notranslate">POL</span></li>
            <li><span class="notranslate">KOR</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their respective academy alliances.</p>
        <h2>City and Gathering Protection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>NAP alliances will not attack each other's cities or Gathering under any circumstances except during agreed-upon special events.</li>
            <li>Territory Respect: NAP alliances will not touch each other's flags, fortresses, or strongholds. These will be split based on mutual agreements among NAP leaders.</li>
            <li>Killing Event Exceptions: During Killing Events (KE), it is allowed to attack the farms of NAP members but not their main cities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SFC (Sunfire Castle) Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fighting will only be contained to turrets to allow participation rewards and PvP practice.</li>
            <li>Castle will be rotated between <span class="notranslate">LED</span> and <span class="notranslate">EMA</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Presidency Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Titles will be shared fairly across the state.</li>
            <li>Proper rotations will ensure no one holds titles unnecessarily or for extended periods without active use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SvS (Server vs Server) Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All NAP alliances will collaborate during SvS to maximize server performance.</li>
            <li>Focus must remain on defeating enemies from other servers. Internal disputes during SvS are prohibited.</li>
            <li>Active participation from all NAP members is encouraged to ensure the server's success.</li>
            <li>Top 30 Merge: The top 30 players will merge into <span class="notranslate">LED</span> for WAR.</li>
            <li><span class="notranslate">LED</span> will hold Sunfire Castle during SvS events.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Alliances Outside NAP</h2>
        <p>
            Alliances outside of NAP4 are considered fair game and can be attacked by any NAP alliance. This includes city hits, gatherer attacks, and territory disputes.
            Non-NAP alliances may also attack NAP members but are advised to tread cautiously, as the NAP alliances are the most powerful on the server.
        </p>
        <h2>Punishment for Violations</h2>
        <p>To uphold fairness and ensure adherence to the NAP rules, the following penalties will apply for any violations:</p>
